Assumptions:
-  The Elevator will stay at the last floor it had arrived at and will be IDLE until it is given more floor requests
-  The number of floors has to be greater than 1 as a building with 1 floor
-    1 floor building doesn't need an elevator
-    Less than 1 floor is either 0(non existant building) or negative which could represent basements(can still use this program, just have floor 1 as the last floor and top floor be the ground level.)
-  The elevator will be initilized to start on the first floor.
-  The elevator will be working when it is initialized

Not Implemented:
-  Button to close doors faster
-  Button to open doors again/keep doors open
-  Slowly moving up floors(right now it is almost instant, moving from floor to floor)
